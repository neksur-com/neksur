"""src.graph.tenant — tenant-context helpers for the Postgres + AGE pool.

Two surfaces live here:

* :func:`set_tenant_context` — issues ``SET LOCAL app.current_tenant = $1``
  on an *already-open* transaction. The value is scoped to the surrounding
  transaction by ``SET LOCAL`` semantics; ROLLBACK / COMMIT clears it. This
  is the only function that may modify ``app.current_tenant``.

* :func:`reset_session` — issues ``DISCARD ALL`` and is meant to be wired
  as the connection-pool reset hook (e.g., ``server_reset_query`` in
  PgBouncer, or the asyncpg / psycopg pool ``reset`` callback). It defends
  against Pitfall 5 (00-RESEARCH.md): session vars must not leak across
  connection reuse.

The functions are deliberately tiny and free-standing so they can be
called from any pool implementation. :class:`src.graph.client.GraphClient`
exposes :meth:`~src.graph.client.GraphClient.execute_in_tenant` as the
sugar context manager built on top of these primitives.

Pre-conditions / contract:
    * ``conn`` is a :class:`psycopg.AsyncConnection` (psycopg 3.x).
    * For :func:`set_tenant_context`, the caller has already started a
      transaction (``await conn.execute('BEGIN')`` or via the
      ``conn.transaction()`` context manager). ``SET LOCAL`` outside a
      txn is a no-op — Postgres silently drops it — and that would create
      a tenant-isolation hole. Production callers must ensure the txn.
